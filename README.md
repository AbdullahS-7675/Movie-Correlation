# Movie-Correlation
Analyzing a Kaggle dataset on Movies to find correlation between different movie features

In this project a Kaggle dataset containing movies was analyzed to answer the following questions:
1: Does a high movie budget correlate to higher gross earnings?
2: Does a more well known company result in higher gross earnings?

Pandas was used to clean, and analyze the data.
Non numerical data such as Company name, Director, etc..., were given numerical representations to add them to the correlation matrix.
